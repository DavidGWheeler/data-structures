## a collection of me practicing and learning data structures

- Binary Search Tree:
  - ### Goal
   - Create a function to build a Binary Search Tree with the following methods:
      - Build a node [x]
      - Insert a node in the proper location
      - find minVal
      - find maxVal
      - find minDepth
      - find maxDepth
      - find minHeight
      - find maxHeight
      - check for isBal (t/f)
      - balance tree if isBal = f
      - find minDif, returns nearest value to target num.
